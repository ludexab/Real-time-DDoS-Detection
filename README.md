# Real-Time DDoS Detection
This project is ongoing. This is a cybersecurity research to implement an incremental ML model, River, particularly the ARFClasssifier to develop a robust model that adapts to the dynamic nature of modern DDoS attacks by continuously updating its nodes as traffic pass through a given network.

## Dataset
The CICDDoS2019 dataset has been used for this research. Find the download link [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/ssnc74xm6r/1).

## Setup
To setup and replicate this project:
1. From the project folder, run the following command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Visualize the dataset by executing the data-visualization.ipynb file
3. Finally execute the ddos-detection-model.py file.
The trained model will be saved locally to the current project folder.
